collection of dumps taken from [pulseview](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView)

The GUI needs some love, but this is not a rant about that. Maybe another day!

Tl;DR: why does the timeline in pulseview behave unlike every other timeline implementation in every video editor out there !? Also, how hard is it to 'cut' sections of time out for a more condensed view?!

The file names more or less describe the action that was taken when the capture was done.
The captures were done over a few hours with some personal interruptions in between sessions.
The trace labels might not be super accurate. E.G.: the trace labeled `TX` might have been from the pin labeled `RX`. Look at the timing to see which is which.

If the filename isn't super helpful... well, sorry. That was probably one of the first captures I did before implementing a more systematic naming convention.
